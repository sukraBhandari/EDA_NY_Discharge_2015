## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using New York state Hosptial Discharge Dataset from 2015 to better understand:

1. What is the total cost distribution among all patients?
2. Which procedures have the hightest average total medical cost?
3. Which features contribute most to the total medical cost?

The full set of files related to this project are owned by New York State and publicly available [here](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8) for anyone to analyze.  


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The full dataset is in Hospital_Inpatient_Discharges__SPARCS_De-Identified___2015.7z file. The dataset is compressed due to the size of the original dataset.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://sam-bhandu.medium.com/dissecting-medical-costs-using-exploratory-data-analysis-1d8ead4ede64).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
